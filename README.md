# code-player


The project “Code Player” is aimed at developing a platform for beginners who have a keen interest in coding front-end languages like HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This project functions as an online code editor and learning environment where developers can create code snippets and test them.
The main aim of this project is to allow users to write code and see the results as they build without any further efforts of opening browser every now and then. It is a useful and liberating online code editor for developers who are willing to code WebPages.
Code Player has helped a lot in learning and implementing front end technologies like HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript along with JQuery. It has been built by keeping an idea of CodePen that is quite popular nowadays.
Overall, this project has been able to give exposure towards the current industrial scenario in the field of web development.
